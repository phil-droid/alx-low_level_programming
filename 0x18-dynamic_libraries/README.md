In dynamic linking, the names of the external libraries /shared libraries are copied into the final executable; thus, the real linking occurs at run time when the executable file and libraries load to the memory. The operating system performs dynamic linking. Generally, there is only one copy of a shared library is in the memory. Therefore, the size of the executable file is lower. It is possible to update and recompile the external libraries. Moreover, if the shared library code is already available in memory, there will be less load time.

Static linking copies all the libraries required for the program into the final executable file. The linker performs this task, and it is the last step of compilation. The linker combines the relevant libraries with the program code to resolve external references. Finally, the linker generates an executable file suitable for loading into memory. The final statistically linked file contains the calling program and called programs. Generally, these files are large because they are connected with other files.

In brief, static and dynamic linking are two linking mechanisms. The main difference between static and dynamic linking is that static linking copies all library modules used in the program into the final executable file at the final step of the compilation while in dynamic linking, the linking occurs at run time when both executable files and libraries are placed in the memory.
